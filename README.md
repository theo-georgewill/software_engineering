# 🧠 Software Engineering

I began building real-world software in 2019 — years before earning my degree. My portfolio reflects this trajectory, from simple freelance tools to full-stack systems integrated with APIs and OAuth2 platforms like HubSpot.
This is a structured and evolving record of my professional engineering practice, combining:

- 📜 Academic foundation (B.Sc. Computer Science — technical CGPA 4.65/5.00)
- ⚙️ Real-world projects since 2019
- 📈 CPD logs aligned with CEng and MBCS expectations

This repo serves as both:
- A **private evidence base** for formal applications (CEng, BCS, GTV)
- A **public knowledgebase** to support content creation and personal branding
