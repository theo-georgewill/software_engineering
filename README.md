# Software Engineering

A structured and evolving record of my professional engineering practice that combines:

- Academic foundation (B.Sc. Computer Science — technical CGPA 4.65/5.00)
- Real-world projects since 2019
- CPD logs aligned with CEng and MBCS expectations

I began building real-world software in 2019 — years before earning my degree. 

My portfolio reflects this trajectory, from simple freelance tools to full-stack systems integrated with APIs and OAuth2 platforms like HubSpot.

This repo serves as both:
- A **private evidence base** for formal applications (CEng, BCS, GTV)
- A **public knowledgebase** to support content creation and personal branding
