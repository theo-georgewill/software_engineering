# 🔐 Secure Coding Practices

## ✅ Why It Matters
Security is non-negotiable in modern software engineering. Every line of code must minimize risk, prevent exploits, and protect users' data.

## 🔧 My Practices
- **Input Validation & Sanitization**
    - Validate all input using Laravel Form Requests
    - Escape output in Blade templates
- **Authentication & Authorization**
    - Use Laravel’s built-in CSRF protection
    - Role-based access via Gates & Policies
- **Data Encryption**
    - Store sensitive data with Laravel’s `encrypt()` helper
    - Hash passwords with `bcrypt()`
- **API Security**
    - OAuth2 for third-party integrations
    - Rate limiting for endpoints
    - Signature verification for webhooks
- **Error Handling**
    - Never expose stack traces in production
    - Log securely using Laravel’s logging channels
- **Dependency Management**
    - Regular Composer and npm audits
    - Pin versions to prevent malicious updates

## ✅ Real Implementations
- **ClientSync CRM**
    - OAuth2-secured HubSpot integration
    - Webhook HMAC signature validation
- **Bookr**
    - Role-based route protection for admins vs clients

## 🧠 Key Principle
Security is **continuous**: review, test, monitor, and update.
