# 🌐 Node.js – Backend & Tooling

## ✅ Overview
While my primary backend experience is with Laravel, I use Node.js for **API proxies**, **automation scripts**, and integrating JavaScript tooling in modern stacks.

---

## 🔧 Core Competencies
- **Express.js**
    - Basic REST API design for microservices
    - Middleware for auth and logging
- **Package Management**
    - npm and Yarn for dependency handling
- **Build Automation**
    - Gulp and Webpack for asset pipelines
- **API Integration**
    - Used Node.js scripts for OAuth token refresh in multi-platform integrations

---

## ✅ Real-World Usage
- API middleware for handling background tasks in JS-first environments
- CLI tools for build optimization in mixed Laravel/Vue/React projects

---

## ⚙️ Tools
- Express.js
- Axios
- Nodemon for hot reload
- dotenv for environment configs

---

## 🧠 Why It Matters
Node.js complements my PHP/Laravel backend work by providing **lightweight services**, build tooling, and integration flexibility for hybrid applications.
