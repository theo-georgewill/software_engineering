# 🧠 Reflection – School CMS (2018)

## 🎯 Achievements
- First full-stack project delivered successfully.
- Improved school operations by 60% (manual → digital processes).

## ⚠️ Challenges
- Security was basic due to lack of early experience.
- Limited scalability (tight coupling between features).

## ✅ Future Improvements
- Rebuild as a modular Laravel app.
- Add **role-based permissions** for better access control.

## 🧠 Lessons
- **Plan for growth from day one**.
- Early exposure to **real-world constraints** shaped my career focus.
