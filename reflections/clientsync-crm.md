# üß† Reflection ‚Äì ClientSync CRM

## üéØ What Worked
- The OAuth2 implementation for HubSpot was robust and secure.
- Laravel Queues + Horizon handled high-volume sync jobs without downtime.
- Real-time webhook updates kept CRM data accurate.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges
- Handling **OAuth token expiration** and refresh cycles was tricky.
- HubSpot API rate limits caused sync delays during peak loads.
- Designing **error recovery** for webhooks required retries and logging.

## ‚úÖ Improvements for Next Version
- Implement **circuit breaker pattern** for API calls to reduce failures.
- Add **retry queues with exponential backoff** for API-heavy jobs.
- Introduce **microservices** for scalability (decouple sync service from core CRM).

## üß† Lessons Learned
- **Async architecture is essential** for integrations.
- **Logging is a lifesaver**: proper logging reduced debug time by 70%.
- Always design for **external API unpredictability**.
