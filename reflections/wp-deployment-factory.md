# 🧠 Reflection – WP Deployment Factory

## 🎯 Wins
- Cut deployment time from 6 hrs → 45 mins.
- Standardized environments with Docker.
- Enabled junior devs to set up client sites without breaking anything.

## ⚠️ Pain Points
- WP CLI automation scripts were OS-dependent initially.
- Version management of plugins/themes caused inconsistencies.

## ✅ Next Steps
- Add **cross-platform support** for automation scripts.
- Integrate **Composer** for plugin dependency management.
- Implement **multi-site templates** for rapid client onboarding.

## 🧠 Lessons
- Automation pays off after the **second repetitive task**.
- **Documentation is as important as code** for onboarding.
